            "11⁄4 lb. mascarpone",

            "30 amaretti cookies",

            "1 1⁄2 cups long espresso",

        ],
        "method": "Separate the egg whites from the yolks. Whip the egg whites. When they’re firm and frothy, add 3 Tbsp. sugar, then continue whipping. When nearly finished, add another 3 Tbsp. sugar and keep whipping until the egg whites become firm and shiny, resulting in a soft meringue. Work half of the mascarpone with electric beaters, whipping lightly until soft and creamy. Add to the meringues and mix. Whip the yolks with 4 oz. sugar, then add the remaining mascarpone and continue whipping until it becomes a soft and fluffy cream. Prepare around 1 ½ cups of espresso, pour it in a bowl, and sweeten it with maple syrup to taste. Dip 24 amaretti into the coffee, without letting them get too wet or soggy, and place on the bottom of the dessert pan or in individual cups. The cookies must cover the surface without overlapping. Pour the mascarpone mixture and meringue on top of the amaretti, and spread with a spatula. Crumble the remaining amaretti cookies over the mascarpone, then drizzle a few spoonfuls of coffee on top. Pour the mascarpone cream and yolks, covering the surface well. Drizzle a few more spoonfuls of coffee to finish. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze for at least three hours. Serve very cold, almost like ice cream, at 32°F, and, if desired, garnish with coffee and crumbled amaretti.",
